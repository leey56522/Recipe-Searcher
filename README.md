The user can type in the ingredient inthe input to get a list of recipes.
Click on the recipe to get the direction and ingredients.

The orange theme was chosen to improve appetite.

## Things I learned
1. Using async await function to grab data from the meal database API and render it on innerHTML
2. Creating a toggle-able class to determine if a recipe is 'favorite' or not
3. Using local storage to store an array of favorite recipe and manipulating data

## Future update 
The website is currently being remade using React
